### How it works: 

Wallet gets drained ----> CUSTOM SMART CONTRACT -----> YOUR BSC ADDRESS

> This only will work with wallets that have 50 busd or more for stealth

> The smart contract address appears in the transaction not yours. This is also for stealth.

This script will let you drain BUSD from the target address

This is a free community code that anyone can audit or edit with pull request and works as designed its been used by pro hackers for years to steal crypto undetected

> THIS SMART CONTRACT IS ON A SPECIAL ERC NETWORK THAT FOWARDS IT TO YOUR ADDRESS ON THE REAL BSC CHAIN FOR STEALTH THIS CONTRACT WILL NOT SHOW UP ON BSCSCAN!

- The smart contract will foward the data to you to prevent you from being caught
- The contract has a 2 hour on average delay for added security it can take up to 48 hours though its randomized                                                       - The smart contract is deployed on a custom network for added security it cannot be found by the wallet address the script adds details to a custom blockchain network that will then foward it to you on the bsc network this part is copyrighted
- The smart contract runs from the script in your fork and is running 24/7 so you have full control

---

### Steps that the victim has to do:

- Connect to BNB Network
- Click approve
- Smart contract gets approved then it will foward the data to the attacker's wallet (you)
- Drain wallet

> Cloning this script will not allow my software to send money to you do not clone if you test this script if you do you will be less likely to recieve payments from testing

### FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

1. Which type of crypto does this script drain does it drain all crypto or only one type?
This script is only used to drain one type of crypto which is the type shown in the title. It is impossible to drain multiple tokens in one transaction. If someone offers you a script that does that, it is a scam. It is possible to select the crypto that has the highest balance in the wallet after the user does a signiture though.

2. How effective is this type of script in the real world?
This type of script is very effective in the real world. But I do not authorize people to use this in the real world this script is only meant to be used for testing and as a simulation for testing for an example in police training police often get pepper sprayed and tazed by real devices so that when they run into that in the real world they would be able to understand what that type of device feels like. This is the same thing by this script actually draining crypto it teaches people that this is a real type of scam and that it actually drains your crypto.

3. Do you give people premission to use this in the real world and for something other than testing or educational purposes?
No. I do not give anyone premission to use this against anyone who doesn't give them premission to do that. Please only use this on people who are aware that this is a drainer.

4. How many people try to exploit the automation system that this script has applied?
A lot of people try to exploit this script all the time. That's why this script is constanlty being updated and changed to make sure that it isnt exploited.

5. What is a custom smart contract?
It is a local python system that sends money based of the wallet in the settings file this can be done automactilly or manually.

6. How am I involved in this script what does I do to manage this script?

I mainly manage the data by this script on a server and keep the python script running locally. When people use this script I get the data and am able to foward the crypto to the wallets that are testing this script. If you clone this script I cannot guarentee that you will recieve payments. Payments are made depending on if a testers site is being used for testing and has money comming in from testing it.
